## Key Features

* Fully trained AI with templates and assets for your own use.
* Templates for extracting training data from.
* Administrative scripts for training the AI, testing the model accuracy etc.

## How To Use

To use Railguard:

* Source Code
  - Clone this repository via the Command Line with `git clone https://github.com/ameasere/Railguard`.
  - Install [Python <3.10](https://python.org) for your OS/Architecture, and add to your PATH.
  - Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and set up a development environment.
  - Install Python in Anaconda, preferably 3.9.
  - Install the project requirements via the requirements.txt file, make sure you have the GPU
  version of Tensorflow in Anaconda.
  > Any issues with installation, consult [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2bRDhmkh2s).
  - Execute the `main.py` file via the Command Line with `python main.py`, or using an IDE.
    - We highly recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), that is how we developed Railguard!



> **Note**
> As of the last README commit/update, Python 3.10+ is not supported. This is because Tensorflow GPU support was dropped after this version. Versions below 3.10 are **tested and verified** to work; the older you pick, the less likely however.
